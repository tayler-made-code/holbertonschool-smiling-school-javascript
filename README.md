# Holberton Smiling School (Bootstrap Project)

![homepage](https://iili.io/J8lvMQV.jpg)

## About the Project
This project was one of my favorites to work on during my Third Trimester at Atlas(Formerly Holberton). We were tasked with developing a website from scratch using Figma designs and Bootstrap. This project stands as a testament to my skills as a developer boasting fully functional and dynamic pages.

## My Approach
Time was not my ally during this project due to personal responsibilities and my student tutor responsiblities. I decided a more methodical approach would be necessary if I was going to make it to the finish line. Bootstrap did provide a solid framework, but it was my JavaScript that truly brought the website to life.

## Challenges Faced
Every project will have it's hurdles, and for me it was the video cards. Hours were spent tweaking and refining them until they felt right. This challenge was necessary though as I was able to reuse my code througout the project and spend the rest of my time working in areas that were going to need a more tailored approach
